# Host Installation
---

This article describes the basic installation of DataKit.

## Register/log in to <<<custom_key.brand_name>>> {#login-guance}

The browser visits the [<<<custom_key.brand_name>>> registration](https://auth.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/redirectpage/register){:target="_blank"} portal, fills in the corresponding information, and then [logs in to <<<custom_key.brand_name>>>](https://console.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/pageloading/login){:target="_blank"}.

## Get the Installation Command {#get-install}

Log in to the workspace, click "Integration" on the left and select "Datakit" at the top, and you can see the installation commands of various platforms.

> Note that the following Linux/Mac/Windows installer can automatically identify the hardware platform (arm/x86, 32bit/64bit) without making a hardware platform selection.
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Linux/macOS"

    The installation command supports `bash` and `ash`([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.14.0](changelog.md#cl-1.14.0)), and the command is roughly as follows:

    - `bash`
    
    ```shell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "unix") }} 
    ```
    
    - `ash`

    ```shell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "unix") (.WithShell "ash") }}
    ```

    After the installation is completed, you will see a prompt that the installation is successful at the terminal.

=== "Windows"

    Installation on Windows requires a Powershell command line installation and must run Powershell as an administrator. Press the Windows key, enter powershell to see the pop-up powershell icon, and right-click and select "Run as an administrator".
    
    ```powershell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "windows") }}
    ```

### Install Specific Version {#version-install}

We can install specific DataKit version, for example 1.2.3:

```shell
{{ InstallCmd 0 (.WithPlatform "unix") (.WithVersion "-1.2.3") }}
```

And the same as Windows:

```powershell
{{ InstallCmd 0 (.WithPlatform "windows") (.WithVersion "-1.2.3") }}
```

## Additional Supported Environment Variable {#extra-envs}

If you need to define some DataKit configuration during the installation phase, you can add environment variables to the installation command, just append them before `DK_DATAWAY` For example, append the `DK_NAMESPACE` setting:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```shell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "unix") (.WithEnvs "DK_NAMESPACE" "<namespace>" ) }}
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "windows") (.WithEnvs "DK_NAMESPACE" "<namespace>" ) }}
    ```
---
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
The setting format of the two environment variables is:

```shell
# Windows: Multiple environment variables are divided by semicolons
$env:NAME1="value1"; $env:Name2="value2"

# Linux/Mac: Multiple environment variables are divided by spaces
NAME1="value1" NAME2="value2"
```

The environment variables supported by the installation script are as follows (supported by the whole platform).
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    1. These environment variable settings are not supported for [full offline installation](datakit-offline-install.md#offline). However, these environment variables can be set by [proxy](datakit-offline-install.md#with-datakit) and [setting local installation address](datakit-offline-install.md#with-nginx).
    1. These environment variables are only effective in installation mode; they do not take effect in upgrade mode.
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

### Most Commonly Used Environment Variables {#common-envs}

- `DK_DATAWAY`: Specify the DataWay address, and the DataKit installation command has been brought by default
- `DK_GLOBAL_TAGS`: Deprecated, DK_GLOBAL_HOST_TAGS instead
- `DK_GLOBAL_HOST_TAGS`: Support the installation phase to fill in the global host tag, format example: `host=__datakit_hostname,host_ip=__datakit_ip` (multiple tags are separated by English commas)
- `DK_GLOBAL_ELECTION_TAGS`: Support filling in the global election tag during the installation phase，format example: `project=my-porject,cluster=my-cluster` (support filling in the global election tag during the installation phase)
- `DK_DEF_INPUTS`: List of collector names opened by default, format example: `cpu,mem,disk`. We can also ban some default inputs by putting a `-` prefix at input name, such as `-cpu,-mem,-disk`. But if mixed them, such as `cpu,mem,-disk,-system`, we only accept the banned list, the effect is only `disk` and `system` disabled, but others enabled.
- `DK_CLOUD_PROVIDER`: Support filling in cloud vendors during installation (Currently support following clouds `aliyun/aws/tencent/hwcloud/azure`). **Deprecated:** Datakit can infer cloud type automatically.
- `DK_USER_NAME`：Datakit service running user name. Default is `root`. More details is in *Attention* below.
- `DK_LITE`： When installing the simplified DataKit, you can set this variable to `1`. ([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.14.0](changelog.md#cl-1.14.0))
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ tip "Disable all default inputs[:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.5.5](changelog.md#cl-1.5.5)"

    We can set `DK_DEF_INPUTS` to `-` to disable all default inputs:

    ```shell
    DK_DEF_INPUTS="-" \
    DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>?token=<TOKEN> \
    bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

    Beside, if Datakit has been installed before, we must delete all default inputs *.conf* files manually. During installing, Datakit able to add new inputs configure, not cant delete them.

???+ attention "Attention"

    For privilege reason, using `DK_USER_NAME` with not `root` name could cause following collector unavailable:

    - [eBPF](../integrations/ebpf.md){:target="_blank"}

    In addition, the following items need to be noted.

    - Manually create user and group first, then start install. There are difference between Linux distribution releases, below commands are for reference:

        === "CentOS/RedHat"

            ```sh
            groupadd --system datakit

            adduser --system --no-create-home datakit -g datakit

            usermod -s /sbin/nologin datakit
            ```

        === "Ubuntu/Debian"

            ```sh
            groupadd --system datakit

            adduser --system --no-create-home datakit
            
            usermod -a -G datakit datakit

            usermod -s /usr/sbin/nologin datakit
            ```

        === "其它 Linux"

            ```sh
            groupadd --system datakit
            
            adduser --system --no-create-home datakit
            
            usermod -a -G datakit datakit
            
            usermod -s /bin/false datakit
            ```

        ```sh

```

- Enable host inject:

```shell
DK_APM_INSTRUMENTATION_ENABLED=docker \
  DK_DATAWAY=https://openway.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>?token=<TOKEN> \
  bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/datakit/install.sh)"
```

For host deployment, after DataKit is installed, reopen a terminal and restart the corresponding Java/Python application.

To enable or disable this feature, modify the value of the `instrumentation_enabled` configuration under `[apm_inject]` in the `datakit.conf` file:

- Value `"host"`, `"docker"` or `"host,docker"`, enable
- Value `""` or `"disable"`, disable

Notes:

1. Before deleting the files in the DataKit installation directory, you need to uninstall the feature first. Please execute **`datakit tool --remove-apm-auto-inject`** to clean up the system settings and Docker settings.

2. For Docker injection, additional steps are required to install and configure Docker injection and delete injection-related files in the DataKit installation directory

   - After installing and configuring Docker injection, if you need to make it effective for the created container:

   ```shell
   # stop docker service
   systemctl stop docker docker.socket

   # change the runtime of the created container from runc to dk-runc provided by datakit
   datakit tool --change-docker-containers-runtime dk-runc

   # start docker service
   systemctl start docker

   # restart the container that exited due to dockerd restart
   docker start <container_id1> <container_id2> ...
   ```

   - After uninstalling the feature (with Docker injection enabled), if you need to delete all files in the DataKit installation directory:

   ```shell
   # stpp docker service
   systemctl stop docker docker.socket

   # Change the runtime of the created container from dk-runc back to runc
   datakit tool --change-docker-containers-runtime runc

   # start docker service
   systemctl start docker

   # restart the container that exited due to dockerd restart
   docker start <container_id1> <container_id2> ...
   ```

Operating environment requirements:

- Linux system
    - CPU architecture: x86_64 or arm64
    - C standard library: glibc 2.4 and above, or musl
    - Java 8 and above
    - Python 3.7 and above

In Kubernetes, you can inject APM through the [Datakit Operator](datakit-operator.md#datakit-operator-inject-lib).

## FAQ {#faq}
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### :material-chat-question: How to Deal with the Unfriendly Host Name {#bad-hostname}
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
Because DataKit uses Hostname as the basis for data concatenation, in some cases, some host names are not very friendly, such as  `iZbp141ahn....`, but for some reasons, these host names cannot be modified, which brings some troubles to use. In DataKit, this unfriendly host name can be overwritten in the main configuration.

In `datakit.conf`, modify the following configuration and the DataKit will read `ENV_HOSTNAME` to overwrite the current real hostname:

```toml
[environments]
    ENV_HOSTNAME = "your-fake-hostname-for-datakit"
```

> Note: If a host has collected data for a period of time, after changing the host name, the historical data will no longer be associated with the new host name. Changing the host name is equivalent to adding a brand-new host.

### :material-chat-question: Issue on macOS installation {#mac-failed}
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

If it appears during the installation/upgrade process when installing on macOS:

```shell
"launchctl" failed with stderr: /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.datakit.plist: Service is disabled
```

Execute:

```shell
sudo launchctl enable system/datakit
```

Then execute the following command:

```shell
sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.datakit.plist
```

### :material-chat-question: Are there any high-risk operations on files and data in Datakit? {#danger-ops}
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

During its operation, Datakit reads a significant amount of system information based on the collection configuration, such as process lists, hardware and software information (e.g., OS information, CPU, memory, disk, network card, etc.). However, it does not proactively execute deletion or modification of data outside of itself. About file reading and writing, there are two parts: one related to data collection read file/port operations, and one for the necessary file reading and writing operations during Datakit's own runtime.

Host files read/write during data collecting:

- During process information collection and hardware and software information collection, Linux systems will read relevant information from the */proc* directory; Windows systems mainly use WMI and the Golang Windows SDK to obtain these information.

- If log collection is configured, Datakit will scan and read logs that match the configuration (e.g., syslog, user application logs, etc.).

- Port usage: Datakit may open some ports to receive external data for interfacing with other systems. [These ports](datakit-port.md) are opened as needed based on the collector.

- eBPF collection: Due to its particularity, eBPF requires more binary information of the Linux kernel and processes, resulting in the following actions:

    - Analyze the binary files of all (or specified) running programs (dynamic libraries, processes within containers) for symbols and addresses.
    - Read and write files under the kernel DebugFS mount point or interact with the PMU (Performance Monitoring Unit) to place kprobe/uprobe/tracepoint eBPF probes.
    - uprobe probes will modify the CPU instructions of user processes to read relevant data.

In addition to collection, Datakit performs the following file reading and writing operations:

- Its own log files

On Linux, these are located in the */var/log/datakit/* directory; on Windows, they are located in the *C:\Program Files\datakit* directory.

Log files will automatically rotate when they reach a specified size (default 32MB), with a maximum number of rotations (default maximum of 5 + 1 segments).

- Disk cache

Some data collection requires the use of disk cache functionality (which must be manually enabled). This cache will involve file creation and deletion during the generation and consumption process. Disk cache also has a maximum capacity setting; when full, it will automatically perform FIFO deletion operations to prevent disk overflow.

### :material-chat-question: How does Datakit control its own resource consumption? {#resource-limit}
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

Datakit's resource usage can be limited through mechanisms such as cgroup. For more information, see [here](datakit-conf.md#resource-limit). If Datakit is deployed in Kubernetes, see [here](datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#requests-limits).

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
### :material-chat-question: What is Datakit's own observability? {#self-obs}
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

During its operation, Datakit exposes many [internal metrics](datakit-metrics.md). By default, Datakit collects these metrics using the [built-in collector](../integrations/dk.md) and reports them to the user's workspace.

In addition, Datakit also comes with a [monitor command-line](datakit-monitor.md) tool that allows users to view the current operational status as well as the collection and reporting status.
