ElasticSearch collector mainly collects node operation, cluster health, JVM performance, metric performance, retrieval performance and so on.

## Configuration {#config}

### Preconditions {#requirements}

- ElasticSearch version >= 6.0.0
- ElasticSearch collects `Node Stats` metrics by default. If you need to collect `Cluster-Health` related metrics, you need to set `cluster_health = true`
- Setting `cluster_health = true` produces the following measurement
    - `elasticsearch_cluster_health`

- Setting `cluster_stats = true` produces the following measurement
    - `elasticsearch_cluster_stats`

### User Rights Configuration {#user-permission}

If the account password access is turned on, the corresponding permissions need to be configured, otherwise it will lead to the failure of obtaining monitoring information. Elasticsearch, Open District for Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch are currently supported.

#### Elasticsearch {#perm-es}

- Create the role `monitor` and set the following permissions.

```http
POST /_security/role/monitor
{
  "applications": [],
  "cluster": [
      "monitor"
  ],
  "indices": [
      {
          "allow_restricted_indices": false,
          "names": [
              "*"
          ],
          "privileges": [
              "manage_ilm",
              "monitor"
          ]
      }
  ],
  "run_as": []
}
```

- Create a custom user and assign the newly created `monitor` role.
- Please refer to the profile description for additional information.

#### Open Distro for Elasticsearch {#perm-open-es}

- Create a user
- Create the role `monitor` and set the following permissions:

```http
PUT _opendistro/_security/api/roles/monitor
{
  "description": "monitor es cluster",
  "cluster_permissions": [
    "cluster:admin/opendistro/ism/managedindex/explain",
    "cluster_monitor",
    "cluster_composite_ops_ro"
  ],
  "index_permissions": [
    {
      "index_patterns": [
        "*"
      ],
      "fls": [],
      "masked_fields": [],
      "allowed_actions": [
        "read",
        "indices_monitor"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tenant_permissions": []
}
```

- Set the mapping relationship between roles and users

#### OpenSearch {#perm-opensearch}

- Create a user
- Create the role `monitor`, and set the following permissions:

```http
PUT _plugins/_security/api/roles/monitor
{
  "description": "monitor es cluster",
  "cluster_permissions": [
    "cluster:admin/opendistro/ism/managedindex/explain",
    "cluster_monitor",
    "cluster_composite_ops_ro"
  ],
  "index_permissions": [
    {
      "index_patterns": [
        "*"
      ],
      "fls": [],
      "masked_fields": [],
      "allowed_actions": [
        "read",
        "indices_monitor"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tenant_permissions": []
}
```

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

- Set the mapping relationship between roles and users

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
    {{ CodeBlock .InputSample 4 }}
    ```

    Once configured, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    The collector can now be turned on by [ConfigMap injection collector configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting).
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Metric {#metric}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag named `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or other tags can be specified in the configuration by `[inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]`:

``` toml
[inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]
# some_tag = "some_value"
# more_tag = "some_other_value"
# ...
```

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

### `{{$m.Name}}`

- Tags

{{$m.TagsMarkdownTable}}

- Metrics

{{$m.FieldsMarkdownTable}}

{{ end }}

## Logging {#logging}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
???+ attention

    Log collection only supports log collection on installed DataKit hosts

To collect ElasticSearch logs, open `files` in ElasticSearch.conf and write to the absolute path of the ElasticSearch log file. For example:

```toml
[[inputs.{{.InputName}}]]
  ...
[inputs.{{.InputName}}.log]
files = ["/path/to/your/file.log"]
```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

When log collection is turned on, a log with a log `source` of `elasticsearch` is generated by default.

### Log Pipeline Feature Cut Field Description {#pipeline}

- ElasticSearch Universal Log Cutting
  
Example of common log text:

```log
[2021-06-01T11:45:15,927][WARN ][o.e.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor] [master] high disk watermark [90%] exceeded on [A2kEFgMLQ1-vhMdZMJV3Iw][master][/tmp/elasticsearch-cluster/nodes/0] free: 17.1gb[7.3%], shards will be relocated away from this node; currently relocating away shards totalling [0] bytes; the node is expected to continue to exceed the high disk watermark when these relocations are complete
```

The list of cut fields is as follows:

| Field Name | Field Value                         | Description         |
| ---    | ---                            | ---          |
| time   | 1622519115927000000            | Log generation time |
| name   | o.e.c.r.a.DiskThresholdMonitor | Component name     |
| status | WARN                           | Log level     |
| nodeId | master                         | Node name     |

- ElasticSearch Search for Slow Log Cutting
  
Example of Searching for Slow Log Text:

```log
[2021-06-01T11:56:06,712][WARN ][i.s.s.query              ] [master] [shopping][0] took[36.3ms], took_millis[36], total_hits[5 hits], types[], stats[], search_type[QUERY_THEN_FETCH], total_shards[1], source[{"query":{"match":{"name":{"query":"Nariko","operator":"OR","prefix_length":0,"max_expansions":50,"fuzzy_transpositions":true,"lenient":false,"zero_terms_query":"NONE","auto_generate_synonyms_phrase_query":true,"boost":1.0}}},"sort":[{"price":{"order":"desc"}}]}], id[], 
```

The list of cut fields is as follows:

| Field Name   | Field Value              | Description             |
| ---      | ---                 | ---              |

| duration | 36000000            | Request time, in ns |

- ElasticSearch Index Slow Log Cutting

Example of indexing slow log text:

```log
[2021-06-01T11:56:19,084][WARN ][i.i.s.index              ] [master] [shopping/X17jbNZ4SoS65zKTU9ZAJg] took[34.1ms], took_millis[34], type[_doc], id[LgC3xXkBLT9WrDT1Dovp], routing[], source[{"price":222,"name":"hello"}]
```

The list of cut fields is as follows:

| Field Name   | Field Value              | Description             |
| ---      | ---                 | ---              |
