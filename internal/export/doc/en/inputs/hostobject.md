Host Object is used to collect basic host information, such as hardware model, basic resource consumption and so on.

## Configuration {#config}

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

In general, the host object is turned on by default and does not need to be configured.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
    {{ CodeBlock .InputSample 4 }}
    ```
    
    After configuration, restart DataKit.

=== "Kubernetes"

    Can be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting) or [Config ENV_DATAKIT_INPUTS](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#env-setting) .

    Can also be turned on by environment variables, (needs to be added as the default collector in ENV_DEFAULT_ENABLED_INPUTS):
{{ CodeBlock .InputENVSample 4 }}

### Turn on Cloud Synchronization {#cloudinfo}

Datakit turns on cloud synchronization by default, and currently supports Alibaba Cloud/Tencent Cloud/AWS/Huawei Cloud/Microsoft Cloud/Volcano Engine. You can specify the cloud vendor explicitly by setting the cloud_provider tag, or you can detect it automatically by Datakit:

```toml
[inputs.hostobject.tags]
  # There are several kinds of aliyun/tencent/aws/hwcloud/azure supported at present. If not set, Datakit will detect and set this tag automatically
  cloud_provider = "aliyun"
```

You can turn off cloud synchronization by configuring `disable_cloud_provider_sync = true` in the Host Object configuration file.

## Object {#object}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag named `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or other tags can be specified in the configuration by `[inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]`:

``` toml
 [inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

> Note: When adding custom tags here, try not to have the same name as the existing tag key/field key. If it has the same name, DataKit will choose to configure the tag inside to overwrite the collected data, which may cause some data problems.

If cloud synchronization is turned on, the following additional fields will be added (whichever field is synchronized to):

#### `host.disk` {#host-disk}

> In previous versions, only one mount point would be collected for the same device (which specific mount point was collected depended on the order in which the mount points appeared in */proc/self/mountpoint*).

The purpose of this change is to display all devices visible to Datakit to avoid any omissions.
