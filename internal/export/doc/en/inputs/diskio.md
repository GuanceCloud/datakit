Diskio collector is used to collect the index of disk flow and time.

## Configuration {#config}

After successfully installing and starting DataKit, the DiskIO collector will be enabled by default without the need for manual activation.

### Precondition {#requirement}

For some older versions of Windows operating systems, if you encounter an error with DataKit: **"The system cannot find the file specified."**

Run PowerShell as an administrator and execute:

```powershell
diskperf -Y
```

The DataKit service needs to be restarted after successful execution.

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:
    
    ```toml
    {{ CodeBlock .InputSample 4 }}
    ```
    
    Once configured, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Can be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting) or [Config ENV_DATAKIT_INPUTS](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#env-setting) .

    Can also be turned on by environment variables, (needs to be added as the default collector in ENV_DEFAULT_ENABLED_INPUTS):
    
{{ CodeBlock .InputENVSample 4 }}

<!-- markdownlint-enable -->

## Metric {#metric}

For all of the following data collections, a global tag named `host` is appended by default (the tag value is the host name of the DataKit), or it can be named by `[[inputs.diskio.tags]]` alternative host in the configuration.

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

### `{{$m.Name}}`

{{$m.MarkdownTable}}

{{ end }}

### Extended Metric {#extend}

[:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.5.7](../datakit/changelog.md#cl-1.5.7)

### Collecting disk `await` for Linux {#linux-await}

By default, DataKit cannot collect the disk `await` metric. If you need to obtain this metric, you can collect it by [Custom Collector with Python](../integrations/pythond.md).

Preconditions

- [Enable Pythond collector](../developers/pythond.md)

Enter the DataKit installation directory, copy the `pythond.conf.sample` file and rename it to `pythond.conf`. Modify the corresponding configuration as follows:

```toml

[[inputs.pythond]]

    # Python collector name 
    name = 'diskio'  # required

    # Environment variables 
    #envs = ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH',]

    # Python collector executable path (preferably use absolute path) 
    cmd = "python3" # required. python3 is recommended.

    # Relative path of the user script
    dirs = ["diskio"]

```

- Install `sar` command. You can refer to [https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat#installation](https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat#installation){:target="_blank"}

Install from Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt-get install sysstat

sudo vi /etc/default/sysstat
# change ENABLED="false" to ENABLED="true"

sudo service sysstat restart
```

After installation, you can ran the following command to check if it was successful.

```shell
sar -d -p 3 1

### Collect Scripts {#py-script}

Create file *<DataKit Dir\>/python.d/diskio/diskio.py* and add the following content:

```python
import subprocess
import re
from datakit_framework import DataKitFramework


class DiskIO(DataKitFramework):
    name = "diskio"
    interval = 10

    def run(self):
        stats = self.getStats()

        data = []

        for s in stats:
            tags = {
                "name": s.get("DEV", "")
            }
            awaitVal = 0.0
            svctmVal = 0.0

            try:
                awaitVal = float(s.get("await"))
            except:
                awaitVal = 0.0
            try:
                svctmVal = float(s.get("svctm"))
            except:
                svctmVal = 0.0

            fields = {
                "await": awaitVal,
                "svctm": svctmVal
            }
            data.append({
                "measurement": "diskio",
                "tags": tags,
                "fields": fields
            })

        in_data = {
            "M": data,
            "input": "datakitpy"
        }

        return self.report(in_data)

    def getStats(self):
        result = subprocess.run(
            ["sar", "-d", "-p", "3", "1"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
        output = result.stdout.decode("utf-8")

        str_list = output.splitlines()

        columns = []
        stats = []
        pattern = r'\s+'
        isAverage = False
        for l in enumerate(str_list):
            index, content = l
            if index < 2:
                continue

            stat = re.split(pattern, content)

            if len(stat) == 0 or stat[0] == "":
                isAverage = True
                continue

            if not isAverage:
                continue
            if "await" in stat and "DEV" in stat:
                columns = stat
            else:
                stat_info = {}
                if len(stat) != len(columns):
                    continue

                for s in enumerate(columns):
                    index, name = s
                    if index == 0:
                        continue
                    stat_info[name] = stat[index]
                stats.append(stat_info) 
        return stats

```

After saving the file, restart DataKit and you will be able to see the corresponding metrics on the <<<custom_key.brand_name>>> shortly.

### Metric List {#ext-metrics}

The `sar` command can obtain many useful [disk metrics](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sar.1.html){:target="_blank"}. The above script only collect `await` and `svctm`. If you need to collect additional metrics, you can modify the script accordingly.

| Metric  | Description                                                                                                                                                                      | Type  | Unit |
| ----    | ----                                                                                                                                                                             | ----  | ---- |
| `await` | The average time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests issued to the device to be served.  This includes the time spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servicing them. | float | ms   |
| `svctm` | awaitThe average service time (in milliseconds) for I/O requests that were issued to the device.                                                                                 | float | ms   |

## FAQ {#faq}

### What is the data source on Linux hosts {#linux-diskio}

On Linux hosts, the metrics are parsed and calculated from the */proc/diskstats* file; an explanation of each column can be found in [docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/ABI/testing/procfs-diskstats){:target="_blank"};

The corresponding relationship between some data source columns and indicators is as follows:

| Fields                                     | `diskio` metrics                                                                                               |

Attention:

1. `sector_size` is 512 bytes.
1. All are count but `read_bytes/sec` and `write_bytes/sec`.
