SMI metric display: including GPU card temperature, clock, GPU occupancy rate, memory occupancy rate, memory occupancy of each running program in GPU, etc.

## Configuration {#config}

### Install Driver and CUDA Kit {#install-driver}

See  [https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx]( https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

### Collector Configuration {#input-config}

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Host Installation"

    Go to the `conf.d/{{.Catalog}}` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `{{.InputName}}.conf.sample` and name it `{{.InputName}}.conf`. Examples are as follows:

    ```toml
    {{ CodeBlock .InputSample 4 }}
    ```

    ???+ note

        1. DataKit can remotely collect GPU server indicators through SSH (when remote collection is enabled, the local configuration will be invalid).
        1. The number of `remote_addrs` configured can be more than the number of `remote_users` `remote_passwords` `remote_rsa_paths`.If not enough, it will match the first value.
        1. Can be collected through `remote_addrs`+`remote_users`+`remote_passwords`.
        1. It can also be collected through `remote_addrs`+`remote_users`+`remote_rsa_paths`. (`remote_passwords` will be invalid after configuring the RSA public key).
        1. After turning on remote collection, elections must be turned on. (Prevent multiple DataKit from uploading duplicate data).
        1. For security reasons, you can change the SSH port number or create a dedicated account for GPU remote collection.

    After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).

=== "Kubernetes"

    Can be turned on by [ConfigMap Injection Collector Configuration](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#configmap-setting) or [Config ENV_DATAKIT_INPUTS](../datakit/datakit-daemonset-deploy.md#env-setting) .

    Can also be turned on by environment variables, (needs to be added as the default collector in ENV_DEFAULT_ENABLED_INPUTS):
    
{{ CodeBlock .InputENVSample 4 }}

## Metric {#metric}

For all of the following data collections, the global election tags will added automatically, we can add extra tags in `[inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]` if needed:

``` toml
 [inputs.{{.InputName}}.tags]
  # some_tag = "some_value"
  # more_tag = "some_other_value"
  # ...
```

{{ range $i, $m := .Measurements }}

## DCGM Metrics Collection {#dcgm}

- Operating system support: :fontawesome-brands-linux: :material-kubernetes:

DCGM indicator display: including GPU card temperature, clock, GPU occupancy rate, memory occupancy rate, etc.

### DCGM Configuration {#dcgm-config}

#### DCGM Metrics Preconditions {#dcgm-precondition}

Install `dcgm-exporter`, refer to [NVIDIA official website](https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter){:target="_blank"}

#### DCGM Metrics Configuration {#dcgm-input-config}

Go to the `conf.d/Prom` directory under the DataKit installation directory, copy `prom.conf.sample` and name it `prom.conf`. Examples are as follows:

```toml
[[inputs.prom]]
  ## Exporter URLs
  urls = ["http://127.0.0.1:9400/metrics"]

  ## Error ignoring request to url
  ignore_req_err = false

  ## Collector alias
  source = "dcgm"

  ## Collection data output source
  ## Configure this to write collected data to a local file instead of typing the data to the center
  ## You can debug the locally saved metric set directly with the datakit debug --prom-conf /path/to/this/conf command
  ## If url has been configured as the local file path, then --prom-conf takes precedence over debugging the data in the output path
  # output = "/abs/path/to/file"

  ## Maximum size of data collected in bytes
  ## When outputting data to a local file, you can set the upper limit of the size of the collected data
  ## If the size of the collected data exceeds this limit, the collected data will be discarded
  ## The maximum size of collected data is set to 32MB by default
  # max_file_size = 0

  ## Metrics type filtering, optional values are counter, gauge, histogram, summary and untyped
  ## Only counter and gauge metrics are collected by default
  ## If empty, no filtering is performed
  # metric_types = ["counter", "gauge"]

  ## Metric Name Filter: Eligible metrics will be retained
  ## Support regular can configure more than one, that is, satisfy one of them
  ## If blank, no filtering is performed and all metrics are retained
  # metric_name_filter = ["cpu"]

  ## Measurement name prefix
  ## Configure this to prefix the measurement name
  measurement_prefix = "gpu_"

  ## Measurement name
  ## By default, the measurement name will be cut with an underscore "_". The first field after cutting will be the measurement name, and the remaining fields will be the current metric name
  ## If measurement_name is configured, the metric name is not cut
  ## The final measurement name is prefixed with measurement_prefix
  measurement_name = "dcgm"

  ## TLS configuration
  # tls_open = false
  # tls_ca = "/tmp/ca.crt"
  # tls_cert = "/tmp/peer.crt"
  # tls_key = "/tmp/peer.key"

  ## Set to true to turn on election
  election = true

  ## Filter tags, configurable multiple tags
  ## Matching tags will be ignored, but the corresponding data will still be reported
  # tags_ignore = ["xxxx"]

  ## Custom authentication method, currently only supports Bearer Token
  ## token and token_file: Just configure one of them
  # [inputs.prom.auth]
    # type = "bearer_token"
    # token = "xxxxxxxx"
    # token_file = "/tmp/token"

  ## Custom measurement name
  ## You can group metrics that contain the prefix prefix into one measurement
  ## Custom measurement name configuration priority measurement_name Configuration Items
  # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    # prefix = "cpu_"
    # name = "cpu"

  # [[inputs.prom.measurements]]
    # prefix = "mem_"
    # name = "mem"

  ## For data that matches the following tag, discard the data and do not collect it
  # [inputs.prom.ignore_tag_kv_match]
    # key1 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]
    # key2 = [ "val1.*", "val2.*"]

  ## Add additional request headers to HTTP requests for data fetches
  ## Example basic authentication
  # [inputs.prom.http_headers]
    # Authorization = â€œBasic bXl0b21jYXQ="

  ## Rename tag key in prom data
  [inputs.prom.tags_rename]
    overwrite_exist_tags = false
    [inputs.prom.tags_rename.mapping]
    Hostname = "host"
    # tag1 = "new-name-1"
    # tag2 = "new-name-2"
    # tag3 = "new-name-3"

  ## Call the collected metrics to the center as logs
  ## When the service field is left blank, the service tag is set to measurement name
  [inputs.prom.as_logging]
    enable = false
    service = "service_name"

  ## Customize Tags
  # [inputs.prom.tags]
    # some_tag = "some_value"
    # more_tag = "some_other_value"
```

After configuration, [restart DataKit](../datakit/datakit-service-how-to.md#manage-service).
