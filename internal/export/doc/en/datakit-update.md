# DataKit Upgrade
---

DataKit supports both manual and automatic upgrade.

## Requirements {#req}

- Automatic upgrade require DataKit version >= 1.1.6-rc1
- There is no version requirement for manual upgrade

### Manually Upgrade {#manual}

Directly execute the following command to view the current DataKit version. If the latest version is available online, the corresponding upgrade
command will be prompted, such as:

> - For remote upgrade, you must upgrade DataKit to [1.5.9](changelog.md#cl-1.5.9)+
> - If [DataKit < 1.2.7](changelog.md#cl-1.2.7), you can only use `datakit --version`
> - If DataKit < 1.2.0, [use the upgrade command directly](changelog.md#cl-1.2.0-break-changes)

If the DataKit is currently in proxy mode, the proxy settings will be automatically added to the prompt command of automatic upgrade:

=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```shell
    HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.100.64.198:9530 DK_UPGRADE=1 ...
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ``` powershell
    $env:HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.100.64.198:9530"; $env:DK_UPGRADE="1" ...
    ```

### Remote Update Service {#auto}

[:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.5.9](changelog.md#cl-1.5.9) Â· [:octicons-beaker-24: Experimental](index.md#experimental)

> Note: The service does not support DataKit installed in k8s.

During the installation of DataKit, an additional remote update service is installed by default, which is specifically used to upgrade the DataKit version. If you are using an older version of DataKit, you can specify additional parameters in the DataKit upgrade command to install this service:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->

=== "Public Network Installation"

    ```shell hl_lines="2"
    DK_UPGRADE=1 \
      DK_UPGRADE_MANAGER=1 \
      bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

=== "Offline Update"

    [:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.38.1](changelog.md#cl-1.38.1)

    If you have [synchronized the DataKit installation package offline](datakit-offline-install.md#offline-advanced), assuming the offline installation package address is `http://my.static.com/datakit`, the upgrade command here is

    ```shell hl_lines="3"
    DK_UPGRADE=1 \
      DK_UPGRADE_MANAGER=1 \
      DK_INSTALLER_BASE_URL="http://my.static.com/datakit"  \
      bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

???+ note

    The service will bind to the `0.0.0.0:9542` address by default. If this address/port is occupied, you can specify an alternative:

    ```shell hl_lines="3"
    DK_UPGRADE=1 \
      DK_UPGRADE_MANAGER=1 \
      DK_UPGRADE_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:19542 \
      bash -c "$(curl -L https://static.<<<custom_key.brand_main_domain>>>/datakit/install.sh)"
    ```

---

Since the service provides an HTTP API, it has the following parameters available ([:octicons-tag-24: Version-1.38.1](changelog.md#cl-1.38.1)):

- **`version`**: Upgrade/Downgrade DataKit to a specified version number (if it's an offline installation, ensure that the specified version's resources has been synchronized)
- **`force`**: If the current DataKit is not running or behaving abnormally, you can use this parameter to force an upgrade and start DataKit service

You can manually call APIs to achieve remote updates, or use DCA to achieve remote updates.

=== "Manual Invocation"

    ```shell
    # Update to the latest DataKit version
    curl -XPOST "http://<datakit-ip>:9542/v1/datakit/upgrade"

    {"msg":"success"}

    # Update to a specific DataKit version
    curl -XPOST "http://<datakit-ip>:9542/v1/datakit/upgrade?version=3.4.5"

    # Force upgrade the DataKit
    curl -XPOST "http://<datakit-ip>:9542/v1/datakit/upgrade?force=1"
    ```

=== "DCA"

    See [DCA Documentation](../dca/index.md).

???+ info

    - The upgrade process may take a long time depending on network bandwidth (essentially equivalent to manually invoking the DataKit upgrade command), please wait patiently for the API to return. If interrupted midway, **its behavior is undefined**.
    - During the upgrade process, if the specified version does not exist, the request will return an error (version `3.4.5` does not exist):

    ```json
    {
      "error_code": "datakit.upgradeFailed",
      "message": "unable to download script file http://my.static.com/datakit/install-3.4.5.sh:  resonse status: 404 Not Found"
    }
    ```

    - If DataKit is not running, it will return an error(we can specify **force** to fix that):

    ```json
    {
      "error_code": "datakit.upgradeFailed",
      "message": "get datakit version failed: unable to query current DataKit version: Get \"http://localhost:9529/v1/ping\": dial tcp localhost:9529 connect: connection refused)"
    }
    ```

### Offline Upgrade {#offline-upgrade}

Please refer to [Offline Install](datakit-offline-install.md) related sections.

### DataKit Version Downgrade {#downgrade}

If the new version is unsatisfactory and eager to roll back the recovery function of the old version, you can directly reverse upgrade in the following ways:
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
=== "Linux/macOS"

    ```shell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "unix") (.WithUpgrade true) (.WithVersion "1.2.3") }}
    ```
=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
{{ InstallCmd 4 (.WithPlatform "windows") (.WithUpgrade true) (.WithVersion "1.2.3") }}
    ```
<!-- markdownlint-enable -->
The version number here can be found on the [DataKit release history](changelog-{{.Year}}.md) page. Currently, only rollback to [1.2.0](changelog.md#cl-1.2.0) is supported, and previous rc versions do not recommend rollback. After rolling back the version, you may encounter some configurations that are only available in the new version, which cannot be resolved in the rolled back version. For the time being, you can only manually adjust the configuration to adapt to the old version of DataKit.

## FAQ {#faq}

### Differences Between Updating and Installing {#upgrade-vs-install}

To upgrade to a newer version of DataKit, you can do so by:

- Reinstallation
- [Executing the upgrade command](datakit-update.md#manual)

On a host where DataKit is already installed, it is recommended to upgrade to a newer version using the upgrade command rather than reinstalling. If you reinstall, all configurations in [*datakit.conf*](datakit-conf.md#maincfg-example) will be reset to their default settings, such as global tag configurations, port settings, and so on. This may not be desirable.

However, whether you reinstall or execute the upgrade command, all the collectors(inputs) configurations are not reset to default.

### Version Detection Failed Processing {#version-check-failed}

During the DataKit installation/upgrade process, the installer detects the currently running version of the DataKit to ensure that the version is the upgraded version.

However, in some cases, the older version of the DataKit service did not uninstall successfully, resulting in the detection process discovering that the current running DataKit version number is still the older version number:

```shell
2022-09-22T21:20:35.967+0800    ERROR   installer  installer/main.go:374  checkIsNewVersion: current version: 1.4.13, expect 1.4.16
```

At this point, we can force the old version of DataKit to stop and restart the DataKit:

``` shell
datakit service -T # Stop service
datakit service -S # Start a new service

# If not, uninstall the DataKit service and then reinstall the service
datakit service -U # uninstall service
datakit service -I # reinstall service

# After the above operations are completed, confirm whether the next DataKit version is the latest version

datakit version # Confirm that the current running DataKit is the latest version
