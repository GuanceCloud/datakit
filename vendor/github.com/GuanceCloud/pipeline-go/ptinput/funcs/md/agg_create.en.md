Function prototype: `fn agg_create(bucket: str, on_interval: str = "60s", on_count: int = 0, keep_value: bool = false, const_tags: map[string]string = nil, category: str = "M")`

Function description: Create an aggregation measurement, set the time or number of times through `on_interval` or `on_count` as the aggregation period, upload the aggregated data after the aggregation is completed, and choose whether to keep the last aggregated data.

- `const_tags`: Custom tags, empty by default.
